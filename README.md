# ons-median-incomes


with this project, it uses the excel file from the ONS website which contains the financial stats and The effects of taxes and benefits on household income, disposable income estimate. https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/personalandhouseholdfinances/incomeandwealth/datasets/householddisposableincomeandinequality
this project extracts the data from this xlsx file to chart the timeseries of median disposable household income from 1977 to 2022/23
to extract this data I used the library pandas as it is a popular library used for reading, loading, and creating excel, csv, json files and more which therefore made it convinient for me to use it


with this info I extracted I was then able to use the the python package Matplotlib to convert this data and place it into a chart form to make it easier for people to view by creating a visual representation of it.
